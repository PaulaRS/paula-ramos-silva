Planktonic gastropods are among the most vulnerable calcifiers since they inhabit the open ocean and make thin shells of calcium carbonate. Still, it is difficult to predict the future of their small shells in acidifying oceans. The Marie Skłodowska-Curie project EPIC aimed at studying the evolutionary processes by which shell formation evolved in planktonic gastropods and forecast their potential to adapt under long-term OA.","tags":["EPIC","transcriptomics","proteomics","evolution","biominerals","molluscs"],"title":"Evolution of Planktonic Gastropod Calcification","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1664236800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1664236800,"objectID":"1e7bdc23c72062851ba4a76a0a0ef164","permalink":"https://paulars.github.io/project/evospore/","publishdate":"2022-09-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/evospore/","section":"project","summary":"The project EvoSpore was funded by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology. The goal was to uncover the origin and evolution of bacterial endosporulation through comparative genomics.
