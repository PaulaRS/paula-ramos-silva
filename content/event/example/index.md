summary: It is always an enormous pleasure to speak to the museum visitors about our research. This time I have teamed up with Giada Spagliardi (Naturalis) to share our passion for sea shells and explain *how* and *why* they are used by scientists. We showed how shells are produced, how they can be used as environmental sentinels, and to predict evolution.
