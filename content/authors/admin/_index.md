I am an evolutionary biologist passionate about biological data with over 12 years experience in research and education. I combine large-scale omics data (genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics) with advanced microscopy to address diverse questions, from the evolution of bacterial development to the formation of animal skeletons. My approach is to identify/compile the genetic machinery involved in these processes and trace their evolutionary paths across species in order to discover major transitions under global change.
