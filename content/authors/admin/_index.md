I bring over 16 years of diverse experience in tech support, research, and education to the table as a seasoned bioinformatician and molecular biologist. Throughout my career, I've integrated large-scale omics data with advanced microscopy techniques to delve into deep evolutionary questions, from the evolution of bacterial spores to the formation of animal skeletons. With a flexible approach, a service-oriented mindset, and a relentless drive for results, I'm now seeking a new opportunity where I can elevate my passion for multi-omics data to the next level.
