title: Evolution of Planktonic Gastropod Calcification
summary: Ocean acidification (OA) reduces the amount of calcium carbonate in seawater, placing a wide range of marine calcifiers under stress. Planktonic gastropods are among the most vulnerable calcifiers since they inhabit the open ocean and make thin shells of calcium carbonate. Still, it is difficult to predict the future of their small shells in acidifying oceans. The Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie project EPIC aimed at studying the evolutionary processes by which shell formation evolved in planktonic gastropods and forecast their potential to adapt under long-term OA.
