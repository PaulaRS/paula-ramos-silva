title: Evolution of Planktonic Gastropod Calcification
summary: Ocean acidification due to increasing CO2 reduces the amount of carbonate ions in seawater, putting a wide range of marine calcifiers at risk. Sea butterflies are among the most vulnerable calcifiers since they inhabit the open ocean and make thin shells of calcium carbonate. Genetic tools for these planktonic snails are scarce, making it difficult to predict their future in acidified waters. The Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie project EPIC aimed at studying the molecular processes by which shell formation evolved in sea butterflies over macroevolutionary scales, and to inform on their potential to adapt under long-term ocean acidification.
