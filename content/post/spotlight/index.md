title: The secrets of sea shells 🐚
subtitle: I love speaking to the museum visitors about our research 🐚. On this day the sun was shinning bright in Leiden, which doesn't invite for a day at the museum but, we had a superb audience! I have teamed up with Giada Spagliardi (MSc student at Naturalis) to share our passion for sea shells and explain **how** and **why** they are used by scientists like ourselves. During this Spolight session we explained not only how shells are built but also how they serve as environmental sentinels and how they can be used to predict evolution.
