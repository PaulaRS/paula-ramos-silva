title: The amazing shells of sea butterflies
subtitle: It is always an enormous pleasure to speak to the museum visitors about our research üêö. This time I have teamed up with Giada Spagliardi (Naturalis) to share our passion for sea shells and explain **how** and **why** they are used by scientists. During this Spolight we explained not only how shells are built but also how they serve as environmental sentinels and how they can be used to predict evolution.
