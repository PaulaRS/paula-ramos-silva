title: Helical crystals in the shells of sea butterflies and adaptation to flow
subtitle: With their flapping wing-like appendages, sea butterflies are unique inhabitants of the open ocean. These pelagic snails are active swimmers, but also drifters, which makes them subject to a diverse range of flow regimes around their shells and their bodies. Some sea butterflies have developed shells made of crystal fibers that coil in perfect helices of a few nanometers. These enigmatic helical crystals have been the topic of intense discussion by [**material scientists**] (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1557/s43577-021-00229-7) and their helical nature has been recently questioned. However, in two recent collaborative works between Naturalis, University of Granada and the AGH University of Science and Technology in Krak√≥w we provide unambiguous evidence that the calcium carbonate fibers secreted by sea buterflies describe true helical trajectories during growth.
