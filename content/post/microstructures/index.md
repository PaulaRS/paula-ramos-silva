title: Helical crystals in shells of sea butterflies - adaptation to flow
subtitle: With their flapping wing-like appendages, sea butterflies are unique inhabitants of the open ocean. These pelagic snails are active swimmers, but also drift and perform diel vertical migrations in the water column, which makes them subject to 
a diverse range of flow regimes around their shells and their bodies. Some sea butterflies have developed shells made of calcium carbonate fibers that coil making perfect helical crystals at the nanometer scale. This enigmatic structure has been the subject of intense discussion by material scientists.
