title: Evolution and biomineralization of pteropod shells
subtitle: My promotional video for the review paper [_Evolution and biomineralization of pteropod shells_](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1047847721000848) was released. This video was created in collaboration with [Studio de Maan](https://studiodemaan.nl) and it gives a glimpse of the striking diversity of shell walls made by sea butterflies. You can watch it on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_mzspO0Jzw). Sea butterflies' shells are widely regarded as bioindicators of ocean acidification. Can they also be used as inspiration for the design of thin, yet mechanically strong materials?
