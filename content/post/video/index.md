title: Evolution and biomineralization of pteropod shells
subtitle: The promotional video of  the review paper [**Evolution and biomineralization of pteropod shells**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1047847721000848) was released. This video was created in collaboration with [Studio de Maan](https://studiodemaan.nl) and it gives a glimpse of the striking diversity of shell walls made by sea butterflies (or pteropods). You can watch it on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_mzspO0Jzw). Sea butterflies are small gastropods that spend their entire live swimming and drifting in the open ocean. They are widely regarded as bioindicators of ocean acidification because they build thin shells of aragonite, a forn of calcium carbonate. Despite being thin, pteropod shells are very strong and uniquely built to withstand different water flows. They are an inspiration for the design of ultrathin and strong materials.
